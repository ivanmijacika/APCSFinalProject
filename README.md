**Description:**

This is a 2D platformer/sandbox game built with Java and Processing, with core features similar to that of Terraria or Minecraft. You would be able to break and place blocks, while exploring the generated world and using its resources to make it your own. The camera follows the player around to allow for exploration of the large world, which you can save to a file to continue playing later.
